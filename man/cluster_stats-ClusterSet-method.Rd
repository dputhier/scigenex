\usage{
\S4method{cluster_stats}{ClusterSet}(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a ClusterSet object.}
}
\description{
Compute statistics about the clusters
}
\details{
For each cluster this function computes:
- The sum of (normalized) counts divided by the number of genes (cluster size). 
This gives a good estimates of whether the genes are weakly or highly expressed (*i.e* housekeeping)
- The variance. This provides an estimate of the dispertion of the values inside a cluster.
- The standard deviation. This provides an estimate of the dispertion of the values inside a cluster.
- The coefficient of variation. This provides an estimate of the dispertion of the values inside a cluster (normalized by the mean expression).
