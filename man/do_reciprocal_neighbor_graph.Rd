\title{Construct a graph based on selected genes in a ClusterSet object and their neighbors}
\usage{
do_reciprocal_neighbor_graph(object = NULL, output_path = NULL, name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A ClusterSet object.}

\item{output_path}{a character indicating the path where the output files will be stored.}

\item{name}{a character string giving the name for the output files. If NULL, a random name is generated.}
}
\value{
The output of this function is a tab-separated file, which serves as input for the MCL algorithm.
}
\description{
This function creates a graph based on the gene selected by select_genes() and their neighbors.
It generates an input file required for the MCL (Markov Cluster) algorithm.
